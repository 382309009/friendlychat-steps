# firechat_flutter

Firechat is a simple, extensible chat widget powered by
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?utm_source=firechat). This version
is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io). The app is built in
several steps of increasing complexity.

These projects assume that your checkout of Flutter is in an adjacent
directory ```flutter```. If it's somewhere else, you need to edit the path in
pubspec.yaml.

## Getting Started with Firebase

Firechat requires Firebase in order to store data. You can
[sign up](https://firebase.google.com/?utm_source=firechat) for a
free account.

The [firebase-dart](https://github.com/flutter/firebase-dart) library
is [documented here](https://flutter.github.io/firebase-dart).

## Building

In the directory of the step you want to build, run ```pub get```
and ```flutter run```.

Use ```flutter run --release``` if you want to remove the "Slow Mode" banner
and improve performance.
