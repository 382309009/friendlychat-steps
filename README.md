# firechat_flutter

Firechat is a simple, extensible chat widget powered by
[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/?utm_source=firechat). This version
is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io). The app is built in several steps of increasing complexity.

These projects assume that your checkout of Flutter is in an adjacent directory ```flutter```. If it's somewhere else, you can edit the path in pubspec.yaml.

## Getting Started with Firebase

Firechat requires Firebase in order to store data. You can
[sign up](https://www.firebase.com/signup/?utm_source=firechat) for a free account.

The [firebase-dart](https://github.com/flutter/firebase-dart) library is [documented here](https://flutter.github.io/firebase-dart).

## Getting Started with Flutter

For help getting started with Flutter, view the [Flutter documentation](http://flutter.io/).

## Building

In the directory of the step you want to build, run ```pub get``` and ```flutter start```.

Use ```flutter start --no-checked``` if you want to remove the "Slow Mode" banner and improve performance.
